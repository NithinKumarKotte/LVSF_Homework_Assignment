1)Details Activiy - Created a new activity to display details of a selected card rendered
on Recyclerview of PlacesListActivity.

Used MapView in activity_detail for rendering Google maps.
Used ToggleButton to render Favorite places.

2)Used SharedPreferences to store favorite place name. Based on whether Favorite Star (Toggle Button)
is clicked or not, place name is either stored or deleted from SharedPreferences. If place is present then highlight 
particular place's cardview in placesListActivity and Favorite star in DetailActivity to yellow else make it transparent.
